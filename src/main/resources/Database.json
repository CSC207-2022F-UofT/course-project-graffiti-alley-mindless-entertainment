        "To do this, you must collect 4 sacred crystals from the 4 nations that inhabit Tartarus. These 4 crystals are: ",
        "◈ Turqoise, the crystal of Water; hidden within a village by a chaotic orc tribe.",
        "◈ Cassiterite, the crystal of Earth; protected by dark knights at the royal castle.",
        "◈ Angelite, the crystal of Air; encased in magic within the sacred tombs of a pyramid.",
        "And... \n ◈ Pyrite, the crystal of Fire; embedded inside the Demon King's heart.",
